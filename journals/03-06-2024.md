Updating Frontend Packages
==========================

#### *March 6, 2024*

- Attempted to build frontend locally using the `npm run start` script to test interaction with a local backend
  - The script failed due to a missing library dependency
  - `npm install` returned over 130 warnings with multiple critical
  - Many outdated or deprecated libraries
  - Current dependencies in `package.json`:

    ```{json}
    "dependencies": {
      "@aws-amplify/ui-react": "^1.2.4",
      "@fontsource/roboto": "^4.5.0",
      "@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view": "^1.3.5",
      "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.14.1",
      "@testing-library/react": "^11.2.7",
      "@testing-library/user-event": "^12.8.3",
      "aws-amplify": "^4.1.2",
      "axios": "^0.21.1",
      "react": "^17.0.2",
      "react-dom": "^17.0.2",
      "react-file-picker": "^0.0.6",
      "react-polling": "^1.0.9",
      "react-router-dom": "^5.2.0",
      "react-scripts": "4.0.3",
      "semantic-ui-css": "^2.4.1",
      "semantic-ui-react": "^2.0.3",
      "web-vitals": "^1.1.2"
    },
    ```

- Switching focus to updating the frontend to current package versions
  - Deleted `node_modules/` and `package-lock.json` to wipe current dependencies
  - Began installing updated versions of packages
  - New dependencies in `package.json` after reinstalling all packages:

    ```{json}
    "dependencies": {
      "@aws-amplify/ui-react": "^6.1.5",
      "@fontsource/roboto": "^5.0.12",
      "@jbrowse/react-linear-genome-view": "^2.10.3",
      "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.5.2",
      "aws-amplify": "^6.0.19",
      "axios": "^1.6.7",
      "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
      "react-file-picker": "^0.0.6",
      "react-polling": "^1.0.9",
      "react-router-dom": "^6.22.2",
      "react-scripts": "^5.0.1",
      "semantic-ui-css": "^2.5.0",
      "semantic-ui-react": "^2.1.5",
      "web-vitals": "^3.5.2"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
      "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.4.2",
      "@testing-library/react": "^14.2.1"
    },
    ```
  - Multiple errors due to changes in package versions
    - Mainly with import statements

- Error with `web-vitals` package
  - Had to install `url` package to fix
- Failed to import `Auth` and `API` from `aws-amplify`
  - AWS Amplify changed the configuration of the library
    - Cannot import from `aws-amplify` anymore but specific sub libraries such as `aws-amplify/auth`
  - Switch import statements for `Auth` to specific functions such as `signIn` or `getCurrentUser`
