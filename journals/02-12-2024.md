Deploying Stacks Locally
========================

#### *February 12, 2024*

- Used [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to switch to Node version 18.0.0
  - Last stable node version for CDK
  - Solved runtime error that I was encountering [before](/journals/01-21-2024.md) when running `cdk deploy --all`
- Encountered error with the runtime of a lambda function
  - The runtime of the function was incompatible with the runtime of the layer
  - Changed the runtime declared upon initialization in `software_stack.py`

- New runtime error:

  ```{bash}
  ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c [ -f 'Pipfile' ] && pipenv lock -r >requirements.txt;
  [ -f 'poetry.lock' ] && poetry export --with-credentials --format requirements.txt --output requirements.txt;
  [ -f 'requirements.txt' ] && pip install -r requirements.txt -t .;" did not complete successfully: exit code: 1
  ```

- The error arises from trying to install `pysam` from `requirements.txt`
  - The subprocess is exiting with code 1 after "Getting requirements to build wheel did not run successfully."
  - Potentially an error with the Python version

- In the `Dockerfile` in the `software/` folder 
  
  ```{Dockerfile}
  RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install python-six && rm -r /var/lib/apt/lists/*
  ```

- What is the `python-six` package?
  - From python docs: [python-six](https://pypi.org/project/six/)
  - Compatibility library between Python 2 and 3
  - Smooths over the differences between Python versions

- The error is coming from the `software/BackendAnnotationIndexer/requirements.txt` file 
  - `pysam` is on line 2
  - Can the error be resolved by specifying a `pysam` version?
  
  ```
  The CRAM format may use bzip2 compression, which is implemented in HTSlib
  by using compression routines from libbzip2 <http://www.bzip.org/>.

  Building HTSlib requires libbzip2 development files to be installed on the
  build machine; you may need to ensure a package such as libbz2-dev (on Debian
  or Ubuntu Linux) or bzip2-devel (on RPM-based Linux distributions or Cygwin)
  is installed.
  ```

- Need to install this `libbzip2` package on the AWS machine
  - Add command to `Dockerfile`?
  - `apt-get -y install libbzip2-dev`
  - The command did not run with `cdk deploy --all`

- `cdk deploy` deploys the stacks to the AWS account
  - To deploy locally we would need to change the codebase to use local emulators of AWS services
  - Not what we want for local testing

- The [CLI docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cli.html#cli-help) show that you can use CDK commands for one stack
  - For example, `cdk synth PipelineStack`
  - Try to synthesize each stack individually and see where the error occurs? (isolate the problem)
- Every stack is running into the same error with `pysam`?

- Combining these parts, the command `FROM --platform=linux/amd64 python:3`
  - Instructs Docker to use the official Python Docker image for Python version 3.x
  - Optimized for the linux/amd64 platform architecture
  - The resulting Docker image will have Python 3.x pre-installed
  - Builds the rest of the image on top of this Python image
- Change to Python 3.11?
  - Same error
