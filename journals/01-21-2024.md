Testing Locally with SAM
========================

#### *January 21, 2024*

* Created a Hello World example SAM project for testing
  * AWS Docs mention [Invoking Lambda functions locally](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-using-invoke.html) using the SAM CLI
* Was able to run `sam local invoke` on the Hello World example
  * An [event](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-concepts.html#gettingstarted-concepts-event) is required to test the function
    * Events are JSON files that contain test data for the function

Example event:
```json
{
  "TemperatureK": 281,
  "WindKmh": -3,
  "HumidityPct": 0.55,
  "PressureHPa": 1020
}
```

#### *February 01,2024*

* Need to get `sam local invoke` command working on the functions in the GPW Backend
  * Create events for the functions to test?
