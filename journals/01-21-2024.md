Testing Locally with SAM
========================

#### *January 21, 2024*

* Created a Hello World example SAM project for testing
  * AWS Docs mention [Invoking Lambda functions locally](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-using-invoke.html) using the SAM CLI
* Experimented with different SAM functions using the hello world template
* Was able to run `sam local invoke` on the Hello World example
  * An [event](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-concepts.html#gettingstarted-concepts-event) is required to test the function
    * Events are JSON files that contain test data for the function

Example event (from AWS Docs):
```json
{
  "TemperatureK": 281,
  "WindKmh": -3,
  "HumidityPct": 0.55,
  "PressureHPa": 1020
}
```

* The event used in the hello world example is a lot more complicated
  * How do you create an event to test a function?

#### *February 01, 2024*

* Need to get `sam local invoke` command working on the functions in the GPW Backend
  * Create events for the functions to test?

* Focusing on `GenomeImporterJob` function in `software/BackendGenomeImporter`
  * Create a JSON file with the necessary parameters for the function event
  * Then the following command can be run to test the function:

```bash
sam local invoke "GenomeImporterJob" -e event.json
```

* Testing can be done through the Lambda console
  * See the AWS Docs on [Testing Lambda functions in the console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/testing-functions.html)
  * You can create a new event and use it to test a function in the Lambda console
    * Is it possible to do this through the CLI?

#### *February 10, 2024*

* The Hello World example from the SAM CLI docs uses a `template.yaml` file
  * Necessary for running `sam build` and `sam local start-api`
  * The AWS CDK docs also mentions a `template.json` file for SAM commands
  * No template file of any kind in the GPW Backend
  * How can you use the SAM CLI commands then?

* [Locally testing AWS CDK applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-cdk-testing.html) references the `sam local start-lambda` command
  * [`sam local start-lambda`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-local-start-lambda.html) starts a local endpoint to emulate AWS Lambda
  * Also requires a `template.yml` file

* `cdk deploy --all` command
  * Deploys all the stacks defined in the backend
  * Should allow the testing of backend APIs, frontend, etc. using local URLs and endpoints
  * Tried to run the command and ran into the same runtime error from before with `cdk synth`

* Also the `cdk ls` command to list all stacks in the application
  * Ran into a runtime error again at the following line of code: 
  ```python
  python_lambda.PythonLayerVersion(self, "GenomeImporterJobRepositories",
  ```
  * This is probably because of the outdated runtime of the Python layers
    * We might be back to updating the layers to a new runtime again
