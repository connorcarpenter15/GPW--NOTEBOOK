Changing Python Lambda Runtimes
===============================

*September 21, 2023*

- Searched through the entire Backend in an attempt to find where the runtime for Python Lambda functions in specified
- Tried to change the version of Python being downloaded in the Dockerfile
- Kept running into the same `RuntimeError` when running `cdk synth`
- Watched a YouTube video on how to set up a Python Lambda Layer and Function
  - [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXjMrWCpaI8&t=930s)
- Read through some of the comments left
  - Researched about the `filesystem` parameter in the `python_lambda.PythonFunction`
  - Checked the `gpw_access_point` and `EFS_PATH`
  - Concluded that the function must be accessing the Elastic File System for the `.zip` file that contains the runtime
- Emailed Dominic about my findings to ask to change the runtime through the AWS Lambda Console

- Got approval from Amy Cayne to move forward with editing AWS Lambda Python Function Runtimes
- Beginning work with Dominic to edit the runtimes through the AWS Lambda Console
