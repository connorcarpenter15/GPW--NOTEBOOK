Unit Test for Stripe Payment Processing
=======================================

*September 3, 2023*

#### Unit Testing
- Created a basic "Hello, world!" unit test to learn how to use unittest (pytest)
  - Most popular Python unit testing framework
  - Should be [compatible with AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/testing.html)
- Anuj did the unit test for the frontend in Javascript
  - Advised him on what framework to use

#### Stripe
- The next step of the project is to get Stripe working on the backend for payment processing
- Created a unit test to test for Stripe integration into the backend
  - Forked the GPW--BACKEND repository
  - Researched the Stripe API and the functions I will need to use ([Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/api))
  - Created a mock Stripe charge sent from the fronted

```{python}
import stripe

stripe.api_key = 'sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'

def processPayment(amount, card_number, exp_month, exp_year, cvc):
    try:
        charge = stripe.Charge.create(
            amount = amount, 
            currency = 'usd',
            source = {
                'object': 'card',
                'number': card_number,
                'exp_month': exp_month,
                'exp_year': exp_year,
                'cvc': cvc
            }
        )
        return charge.status
    except stripe.error.StripeError as e:
        return str(e)
```
  - Created a unit test using pytest to test this Stripe charge

```{python}
import unittest
from payment import processPayment

class TestStripePayment(unittest.TestCase):
    def testProcessPayment(self):
        result = processPayment(1000, '4242424242424242', 12, 25, '123')
        self.assertEqual(result, 'succeeded')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

- Merged the forked repository with the main repository so Dominic could review the code
  - See the pull request [here](https://github.com/amycayne/GPW--BACKEND/pull/3)
