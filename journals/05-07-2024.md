Adding Button Functionality
===========================

#### *May 07, 2024*

* Did genome edit page did not have a home button
* Decided to try adding button functionality to the image in the app header
  * This would allow the user to go to the homepage from any page
* Researched the button object in semantic UI
* Attempted to nest an image in the button object like so:

```{js}
<Button onClick={() => history.push("/")}>
  <Image centered size="large" src="/images/gpw.jpg" />
</Button>
```

* The project uses `useHistory()` from `react-router-dom`
  * This enables the use of the `push()` method to switch pages
* Button functionality is working with the image
  * The image now has the standard button styling, including a border
  * Need to remove the border and shadow from the image
  * Added the `basic` attribute to the button
    * Still a slight border
* Tried making the image a link:

```{js}
<Image centered size="large" src="/images/gpw.jpg"
  onClick={() => history.push("/")}/>
```

* Linked the image to the homepage
  * However, the cursor no longer changes to a pointer
  * User might not know that the image is a link
* Switched back to image inside a button
* Might be able to add specific CSS styling to the button to remove the border
