#### *May 5, 2024*

* Experimenting with the CAD software in the frontend
* Ran the frontend locally using development environment
* Downloaded a genome from the NCBI database
  * [Genome assembly Agelaius phoeniceus 1.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_020745825.1/)
  * Red-winged blackbird genome
* Uploaded the file `GCA_020745825.3_Agelaius_phoeniceus_1.1_genomic.fna`
* Experimented with the genome viewer
* Attempted to add an annotation
  * Need `gff` file type

* There is no "back" button to return to home page from genome viewer
