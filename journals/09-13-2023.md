Last Meeting with Michael
=========================

#### *September 13, 2023*

Michael gave his demo of the admin software that he made. So far it looks
pretty good, but has limited UI. Michael also mentioned some next steps for the
software, including setting up user authentication, an email service to contact
users, and an actual biosecurity check, not just the fake function that he
made. He said that he made his backend to be very similar to the GPW CAD, so it
should be pretty straightforward to implement these features and integrate
Michael's software with the CAD. Doug said that he is going to work with Guzman
and Michael to get a short paper out about the admin workflow behind monitoring
genomes.

Doug also mentioned a postdoc (Anush I think?) that they are trying to work
with. I didn't really gather the whole conversation, but it was something about
using the GPW software for an experiment that they want to do and maybe
applying for a grant. Amy mentioned maybe getting the GPW CAD deployed and
running to give a demo to Anush and others to show the GPW software and gather
more interest. I said that we are working on updating the packages used on the
backend since many have become outdated since Guzman last worked on the
project. I also said that we should hopefully be able to finish this process
and get the software deployed before any demos
